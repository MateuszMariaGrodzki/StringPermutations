### Above arguments are passing by command line as follows: java Main "String" "Number" "Pattern"
> * String - letters from which permutations will be created
> * Number - define length of expected permutation
> * Pattern - allows to narrow printing permutations to user's choice ( dot sign represents eny letter)
### Examples:
> * java Main abcde 3 .b. will print all permutations of length 3 with b as second letter
> * java Main abc 2 .. will print all permutations of length 2
